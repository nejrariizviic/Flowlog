## Project Overview
Unlike traditional social media platforms, FlowLog places a strong emphasis on creating an engaging and personalized user experience that encourages users to actively participate in discussions and share content related to their interests. The platform is built to serve as a space where users can not only share their own thoughts, ideas, and multimedia content such as images, videos, and text updates but also connect with others who share similar passions and opinions. FlowLog integrates intelligent algorithms that recommend content and users based on individual preferences and interactions. Through these features, FlowLog aims to become the go-to platform for content sharing, discussion, and meaningful user connections in an online social environment.

## Key Features
- Personalized User Profiles â€“ users can create and customize their profiles to reflect their interests and identity.
- Content Sharing â€“ ability to post multimedia content, including images, videos, and text updates.
- Engagement & Discussions â€“ users can comment on posts, engage in discussions, and interact with others through likes and replies.
- User Connections â€“ follow other users to stay updated with their latest posts and activities.
- Tailored Content Discovery â€“ intelligent content recommendations based on user preferences and interactions.

## Research & Methodology
A structured methodology was applied to develop the FlowLog platform, which included the following phases:

- Analysis of target users and their needs
- Analysis of existing platforms
- Evaluation of functionality and design
- Defining functional requirements
- UI/UX design and prototyping in Figma
- Prototype testing



## Design & Development
FlowLog is currently in the design and development phase, with a focus on crafting an intuitive and seamless user experience. The UI/UX is being developed in Figma, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
